# Move-Ball
A few examples on how to move a ball around the screen

# Description
move_ball_simple_solution.html will create a green ball, which will move the ball to the right every 1000 ms.
move_ball_edge_solution.html will create a green ball, then moves the ball diagonally.  When it hits the edge of the screen, it will reverse directions and move again diagonally in the opposite direction.
move_ball_bonus.html creates two balls, one light blue and one teal. Each ball moves randomly across the page and reverses direction when it hits a page edge.

# Installation: 
Each of the html files can be shown in a browser. 

# Usage: 
This project shows how to create different sized & colored balls.  It also shows how to set the initial position of each individual ball, as well as showing you can move the ball the page, both vertically and horizontally, as well as setting the edges of your page as boundaries for which the ball will stay in.  It shows examples of the 'setInterval' function which is used to move the ball automatically by setting the parameter of X ms.
